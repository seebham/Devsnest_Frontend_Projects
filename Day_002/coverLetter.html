        <span>Dear Mr. Wakhre,</span>
        <p>I’m writing to you regarding RedCompany’s Web Developer opening, which I discovered on Indeed. I’ve been working as a Web Developer at Grooming Technologies for more than 9 years now, and during that time I’ve revamped web security applications, designed and developed a user-friendly website, and trained over 50 staff members in internal web functions. I’m interested in working for RedCompany because I want to further my own knowledge and interest in web development, and I believe I’ll be able to offer new ideas to help RedCompany reach and surpass the primary objectives mentioned in its job ad.</p>
        <p>My core duties at Grooming Technologies included designing user interfaces, testing and debugging websites, and training staff. Additionally, my work revamping our security applications diminished hacker attacks from 2.3% to 0.02%. I also redesigned our website —increasing visitor clicks by 37% and customer purchases by 20%. Prior to this position, I worked at Focus Solutions as a Web Developer where I assisted in developing a user friendly website that increased sales revenue by 40%.</p>
        <p>This professional experience has helped me improve my skills in leadership, allowed me to gain mastery over necessary development tools, and provided me with extensive knowledge of how to design a user friendly, secure website. I believe my skill set will benefit RedCompany, which has the clear potential to increase online revenue and expand its audience.</p>
        <p>I’m looking forward to discussing the position and my qualifications with you in more detail soon. I feel confident that I fulfill the requirements for the Web Developer position. You can contact me at +91 9850496187, or by email at shubhamisdev@gmail.com. If I have not heard from you in a week, I will reach out to you again. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
        <p>
            Sincerely, <br>
            Shubham
